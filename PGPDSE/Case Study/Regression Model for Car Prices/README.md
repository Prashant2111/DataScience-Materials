# Regression Model for Car Prices
Suppose you are a data scientist working on a project for an insurance company that is trying to understand how the characteristics of a car could impact its price. 

To perform the task, you received a dataset containing 205 observations representing cars with 26 variables defining its characteristics. This dataset was downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Machine Learning repository (the original file and description can be downloaded at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)

You also received a description of the dataset including the definition of each variable.
Your manager asked you to build a model that implements machine learning on the received data.
