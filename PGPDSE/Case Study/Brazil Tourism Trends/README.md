# Brazil Tourism Trends
You have been hired by the department of tourism of Brazil to analyse tourism trends of the past 10 years.

The supplied dataset is in machine format and contains monthly counts of visitors from other countries of the World coming to Brazil. Counts are split by the State into which the visitors arrived as well as the type of transportation they used: Air / Land / River / Sea.

Your task is to create the following charts and dashboards:

1. A timeline showing the overall trend in visitors to Brazil over the period of the dataset.

2. A chart showing the % split between the modes of transportation used for arrival into the country.

3. A chart highlighting any monthly seasonality of arrivals.

4. A map of Brazil comparing states of the country by the number of arriving tourists.

5. A map of the World comparing countries by the number of tourists who visited Brazil.

6. A chart comparing different continents by the number of tourists who visited Brazil.

7. A dashboard combining elements 1, 3 and 5 from above. The Map of the World should act as filter for the dashboard allowing for detailed analysis of trends and seasonality of various countries.
